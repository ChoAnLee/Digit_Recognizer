# digit_recognizer
####  We attend a Kaggle competition - Digit Recognizer. We aim to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. We discover that using simple CNN models can achieve very high accuracy on the MNIST dataset. In this survey paper, we will introduce the method we implemented and comparison between models with different parameters.
